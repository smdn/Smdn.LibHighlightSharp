# Smdn.LibHighlightSharp
[Smdn.LibHighlightSharp](src/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp/) is a wrapper library for using André Simon's [Highlight](http://andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php) on .NET. This assembly provides wrapper classes that make Highlight easy to handle from C#/VB.NET. This package depends on the packages described below.

[Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings](src/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings/) is an assembly compiled directly from the binding classes generated by SWIG. It provides the wrapper classes that calls native code. The NuGet package also includes the native libraries (`.dll`/`.so`/`.dylib`) for each platforms. The version of this package corresponds to the version of the bundled Highlight native library and its SWIG bindings.

If you don't need the wrapper class provided by `Smdn.LibHighlightSharp`, you can directly use the bindings provided by `Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings`.

[Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.LangDefs](src/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.LangDefs/) and [Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Themes](src/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Themes/) are the packages that provide Highlight syntax files (`*.lang`) and theme files (`*.theme`). The version of these package corresponds to the version of the bundled Highlight's syntax files and theme files.

## Usage
Add `<PackageReference>`s to the project file.
```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp" Version="1.*" />
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings" Version="4.*" />
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.LangDefs" Version="4.*" />
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Themes" Version="4.*" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Then write the code like below. The following example highlights and displays the code contained in a `string`.

```cs
using Smdn.LibHighlightSharp;

// Creates an instance that generates code highlighted as a HTML document.
using var hl = new Highlight(GeneratorOutputType.Html);

// Sets 'github' to the theme.
hl.SetTheme("github");

// Sets 'csharp' to the language/syntax of input code.
hl.SetSyntax("csharp");

// Sets other options
hl.Title = "Hello, world!";
hl.SetIncludeStyle(true);

// Generates the highlighted code from string.
var input = @"using System;
Console.WriteLine(""Hello, world!"");";

Console.WriteLine(hl.Generate(input));
```

The generated HTML is displayed as follows.

<a href="/doc/output-example/HelloWorld.html">
<img alt="Highlighted output" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smdn/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp/main/doc/output-example/HelloWorld.svg" width="440" height="60">
</a>

You can also combine the different versions of bindings/syntaxes/themes, as in the following example.

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp" Version="1.*" />

    <!-- Use the native libraries of the latest version of Highlight v4. -->
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings" Version="4.*" />

    <!-- Use syntax and theme files from Highlight v4.0. -->
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.LangDefs" Version="4.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Themes" Version="4.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
```
