# Smdn.LibHighlightSharp
[Smdn.LibHighlightSharp](src/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp/) is a wrapper library for using André Simon's [Highlight](http://andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php), the syntax highlighter, on .NET.

This package provides wrapper classes that make Highlight easy to handle from C#/VB.NET. This package depends on the package `Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings` described below to use native libraries of Highlight.



[Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings](src/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings/) is a class library includes the bindings compiled directly from the sources generated by SWIG. It provides the wrapper classes that calls native code. The NuGet package also includes the native libraries (`.dll`/`.so`/`.dylib`) for each platforms.

The major and minor version numbers of this package corresponds to the version of the bundled Highlight native library and its SWIG bindings.

If you don't need the wrapper class provided by `Smdn.LibHighlightSharp`, you can directly use the bindings provided by `Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings`.



[Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.LangDefs](src/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.LangDefs/) and [Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Themes](src/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Themes/) are the packages that provide Highlight syntax files (`*.lang`) and theme files (`*.theme`).

The major and minor version numbers of these package corresponds to the version of the bundled Highlight's syntax files and theme files.

If you add references to these packages, the syntax and theme files will be copied to the output directory. If you prepare these files by yourself, you can omit reference to these packages.

## Usage
### Syntax highlighting
First, add `<PackageReference>`s to the project file.

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp" Version="1.*" />
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings" Version="4.*" />
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.LangDefs" Version="4.*" />
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Themes" Version="4.*" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Then write the code like below. The following example highlights and displays the code contained in a `string`.

```cs
using Smdn.LibHighlightSharp;

// Creates an instance that generates code highlighted as a HTML document.
using var hl = new Highlight(GeneratorOutputType.Html);

// Sets 'github' to the theme.
hl.SetTheme("github");

// Sets 'csharp' to the language/syntax of input code.
hl.SetSyntax("csharp");

// Sets other options
hl.Title = "Hello, world!";
hl.SetIncludeStyle(true);

// Generates the highlighted code from string.
var input = @"using System;
Console.WriteLine(""Hello, world!"");";

Console.WriteLine(hl.Generate(input));
```

The generated HTML is displayed as follows.

<a href="/doc/output-example/HelloWorld.html">
<img alt="Highlighted output" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smdn/Smdn.LibHighlightSharp/main/doc/output-example/HelloWorld.svg" width="440" height="60">
</a>

See the projects in the [examples](./examples/) directory for more usages.

### Combining different versions
You can combine the different versions of bindings/syntaxes/themes, as in the following example.

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp" Version="1.*" />

    <!-- Use the native libraries of the latest version of Highlight v4. -->
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings" Version="4.*" />

    <!-- Use syntax and theme files from Highlight v4.0. -->
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.LangDefs" Version="4.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Themes" Version="4.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

`Smdn.LibHighlightSharp` and `Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings` can be combined with any version.

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp" Version="1.*" />

    <!-- If *some condition* is true, use the Highlight v4.4 -->
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings" Version="4.4" Condition=" '$(SomeCondition)' == 'true' " />
    <!-- Otherwise, use the Highlight v3.60 -->
    <PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings" Version="3.60" Condition=" '$(SomeCondition)' != 'true' " />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Feature that is version-specific, is resolved by dynamic binding (`System.Dynamic`). Calls to version-specific features will throw an exception or be simply ignored at runtime.

## Troubleshooting at run time
### `DllImport` issues
If the exception `TypeInitializationException` or `DllNotFoundException` occurs like below, the native library may not have been deployed correctly.

```text
Unhandled exception. System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.Bindings.highlightPINVOKE' threw an exception.
 ---> System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'SWIGExceptionHelper' threw an exception.
 ---> System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'highlight-v4_4_0_0' or one of its dependencies. In order to help diagnose loading problems, consider setting the LD_DEBUG environment variable: libhighlight-v4_4_0_0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

First, make sure that the package `Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.NativeBinaries` has been added to your project correctly.

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Smdn.LibHighlightSharp.NativeBinaries" Version="4.4.0" />
```

For Linux or macOS, make sure **Lua 5.3** is installed on your system.

```sh
# install Lua 5.3 using apt-get
sudo apt-get install liblua5.3

# install Lua using Homebrew
brew install lua@5.3
```

If you have copied or moved the output files generated by `dotnet build` or `dotnet publish` to another location, make sure that the native libraries are correctly deployed also.

One of the following native library files must be located in the same directory as the executables or in the `runtimes/<RID>/native/` directory.

- highlight-v*X*_*Y*_0_0.dll (Windows)
- libhighlight-v*X*_*Y*_0_0.so (Linux)
- libhighlight-v*X*_*Y*_0_0.dylib (macOS)

When running on Windows, make sure that the **lua53.dll** is also deployed in the same directory.
