# Examples for Smdn.LibHighlightSharp

## How to run examples
Move to each example directory and execute the command `dotnet run`.

## How to modify libraries
Each example in this directory by default refers to published NuGet packages.

You can change the property `UseLocalProjectInsteadOfPublishedPackage` in file [Directory.Build.props](./Directory.Build.props) to refer to a local project by changing it to `true`.

See [/src/README.md](/src/README.md) for details of building each project and native libraries.
